K-Fold Cross-Validation for K-Nearest Neighbors on MNIST Dataset


Description
The objective of this project is to assess the performance of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm using K-Fold Cross-Validation on the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a well-known benchmark for handwritten digit recognition in machine learning. By applying K-Fold Cross-Validation, we ensure that the model’s performance is evaluated comprehensively and is not biased by a single train-test split.


Dataset
The MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits, each of size 28x28 pixels. The dataset is split into 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. Each image is labeled with a digit from 0 to 9.


Mean and Standard Deviation
The mean accuracy and standard deviation of the cross-validation scores are calculated to provide a summary of the model’s performance. 


Mean accuracy: 97.255714%

Accuracy Std Dev: 0.176872%


Interpretation
High Mean Accuracy: The classifier is performing well, consistently achieving high accuracy in classifying the handwritten digits.
Low Standard Deviation: The model's performance is not only high but also reliable and consistent across different subsets of the dataset. This consistency is crucial for real-world applications, as it indicates that the model will perform well on unseen data, not just the specific splits used in cross-validation.


The combination of a high mean accuracy and a low accuracy standard deviation suggests that the KNN classifier is both effective and reliable for the MNIST dataset. This makes it a strong candidate for tasks involving handwritten digit recognition.
